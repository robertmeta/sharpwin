# Goals

1. The server should be as dumb as possible.
2. Major decisions should be configurable in lisp.
3. System should be "usable by default" meaing:
   once it builds, it works.
4. Server will depend on only clearly defined and 
   checked at compile time things. No secret deps
   on command line tools.
